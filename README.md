This builds up an PDF issue of The Economist by downloading articles from [The Economist's ProQuest page](https://www.proquest.com/publication/41716).

1. You need a valid subscription to ProQuest, either directly or through your university.
2. If your university requires you to login to ProQuest before being able to download articles, as it is most likely, you can either:
	1. Pause the script, login through your university's portal, then resume the script.
	2. Implement the login process of your university by yourself, as I'm not going to implement the login process of a particular university.
